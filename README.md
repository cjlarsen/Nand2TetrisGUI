# Nand2TetrisGUI

Simple user interface to launch shell programs on mac that are part of the "Build a Modern Computer" course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/).

It's a personal app, if you download it you'll have to change the paths to the programs and then rebuild it. They are stored at the top of ViewController.swift.
